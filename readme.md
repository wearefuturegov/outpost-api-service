# Outpost API service

**[API documentation is on the wiki](https://github.com/wearefuturegov/outpost-api-service/wiki)**

This is [Outpost](https://github.com/wearefuturegov/outpost)'s public API component.

It's a simple Node.js app which queries information from a MongoDB collection and publishes it as a read-only, rate-limited REST API.

It's not useful by itself â€” it depends on a public index built by Outpost. The API it outputs is consumable by [Scout](https://github.com/wearefuturegov/scout-x).

## Running it locally

You need Node.js, npm, nvm (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and a working MongoDB database [with the right indices](#indexes) available on `localhost:27017`.

```
nvm use
npm i
npm run dev
```

By default it will be on `localhost:5000/api/v1/services`.

## Running it on the web

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

It's suitable for 12-factor hosting like Heroku. It has a [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) that will make sure the proper MongoDB indices are set up.

```
npm start
```

## Configuration

It expects a few environment variables.

- `DB_URI` overrides the default `localhost:27017/outpost_development` MongoDB connection URI.
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` used for geocoding from `location=` parameters. Needs the geocoding API enabled.

### Indices

It needs the right indices on the MongoDB collection to enable full-text and geo search. Something like:

```
db.indexed_services.createIndex({ name: "text", description: "text" })
db.indexed_services.createIndex({ "locations.coordinates": "2dsphere" })
```

You can create these two, plus an index of taxonomy slugs, automatically with the `npm run prepare-indices` command.
